# TestApp
Just a place holder to study Buildbot integrate with Waf under source code control

This is a test application that I try to set up as a test bed to play with Buildbot, waf, SVN,... 
The goal here is try to setup and build, test automation environment for our next generation software development platform.

Stay tune, will publish more information when I got some milestone.
